# ENVS-193DS_homework-03

## General Information

This repository was created by Christopher Kiorlinski with the purpose of completing homework 3 for ENVS 193DS.
Using self collected data, I sought to identify whether or not the amount of sleep I got affected my score on an online reaction speed test immediatly when I woke up. Time of sleep, stress level, reaction speed, and sleep location was recorded. Sleep data was binned into three bins and analyzed.

## Data and File Information

There are two folders, a code and data folder. All code is in the code folder, along with images used in the document, and all datasets are in the data folder.

The main folder with all the data is homework-03.qmd.

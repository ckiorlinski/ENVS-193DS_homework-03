# Problem 1: Personal Data

## a. 

I could bin recorded days into different sleep lengths, such as "Short (>7 hours)", "Moderate (7-8 hours)", and "Long (<8 hours)", and then find the mean sleep time within each bin because I generally feel more alert when I have had more sleep, so I think Long sleep length will have the best reaction times.

## b.
